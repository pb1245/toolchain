# `wasm` and `wlink`

`wasm` and `wlink` are, respectively, the assembler and linker for WRAMP code.
Assembly code, usually in a .s file, is given to `wasm`, which outputs an object file.
One or more object files can be linked together into a program by `wlink`, outputting
an .srec file.
These .srec files are then passed directly to WRAMPmon via `remote`, or further processed
by `trim` to create a .mem file which can be used as part of Vivado's synthesis tool
when loading new versions of WRAMPmon onto physical Basys3 boards.

`wobj` is also included in this repositroy, `wobj` is an object viewer and disassembler in one.
`wobj` takes .o files, and displays on stdout.

## Added features from `wandwramp/toolchain`
 - Address map using the `.debug` directive and `-d` option in `wlink`

## Usage

`wasm` takes a single input file and produces a single output file, which defaults to
the name of the input file with a .o file extension. Alternatively, an output file can
be chosen using the `-o` argument.

` $ wasm -o output.o input.s `

`wlink` takes an arbitrary number of input files, and produces a single output file, which
defaults to link.out in the current working directory. 
Again, an output file can be chosen.

` $ wlink -o output.srec input1.o input2.o input3.o `

`wlink` can also take several other paramaters.
`-Ttext <address>` provides the memory address to start loading the resulting srec's .text segment.
`-Tdata <address>` provides the memory address to start loading the resulting srec's .data segment. 
`-Tbss <address>` provides the memory address to start loading the resulting srec's .bss segment. 
`-Ebss <address>` provides the memory address that the resulting srec's .bss segment should finish at.
`-v` instructs `wlink` to provide verbose output.
`-d <name>` instructs `wlink` to produce a debug map file which records the addresses of labels with the `.debug` directive.

Exsposed to the programmer there are also three special labels, `bss_size`, `text_size` and `data_size`.
These three labels provide the size of the respective segment evaluated during the linking process.
`la $1, bss_size` will load `$1` with the total size of the .bss segment.

`wobj` first argument must be the object file to be inspected, followed by an optional `-d`, including
this flag instructs `wobj` to display the dissasembly. 

## Building

Building `wasm`, `wlink` and `wobj` simply requires `g++` to be installed.
Type `make`, or specify a single program with `make wasm`, `make wlink` or `make wobj`.
